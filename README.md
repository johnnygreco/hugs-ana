## HSC-HUGs: Hyper Suprime-Cam Hunt for Ultra-diffuse Galaxies
---
This repository contains code for my thesis work, which is focused on the search for [ultra-diffuse galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_diffuse_galaxy) in data from the [Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program](http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/), an ambitious 300-night optical/near-infrared survey with the 8.2-meter [Subaru Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Telescope).
